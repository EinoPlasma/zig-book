## Opening issues or Pull Requests

But you can still contribute to this project in other ways. For example, these are some reasons why you could
[open new issues](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/issues)
on the official repository of the project:

- if you don't understand something, or, if a particular section of the book seems
  confusing to you, you can open an issue to clarify these points.
- to give a feedback, or, a suggestion of improvement.
- to point out an error in the book. This error can be:
    - a typo;
    - it might also be an error in the code examples (i.e. the code example doesn't work when it is supposed to work);
    - a knowledge error in the book, meaning that, there is a mistake in the technical explanation of a subject.

Now, maybe, you want to do something more than just open an issue. Maybe you want to actually
send a Pull Request to be reviewed. For example, if you spot a typo anywhere in the book,
feel free to edit the underlying QMD file
(QMD files are inside the [`Chapters` folder](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/tree/main/Chapters))
of the current chapter to fix the typo, and send a Pull Request with the change.

If you've never done this before, the process is very easy:

- Click the edit this page on the sidebar.

- Make the changes using GitHub's in-page editor and save.

- Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes. "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.

If you send a Pull Request with significant changes, you need to include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution
to Pedro Duarte Faria" in the description of your Pull Request - I need this so I can publish the book.
